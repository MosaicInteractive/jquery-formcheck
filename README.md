jQuery FormCheck
================

I really didn't care for the form validation options available for jQuery, but I *love* the MooTools plugin, [FormCheck].  So I wrote this for jQuery that parses classes in the same way (but without the single quotes because I do not like them), and does some other stuff.  This currently is not nearly as awesome or as complete as [FormCheck], I'm not kidding.

### Alpha Alert!

This code is relatively old, not full-featured, and was programmed for jQuery 1.2.6.  There's no support for radios, selects, options, and who knows what else.  I would love for somebody to fork it and make it way cooler, that's why I stuck it up on GitHub.  If I see the need in the future, I'll update it and write some light documentation.  For now, it is what it is.
